# SixDegrees
### iOS App developed by Daniel Moreno, Sameera Vemulapalli and Amanda Glazer
As we get older, we develop opinions, lifestyles, and habits that limit the number of people we meet organically through our  networks. This makes the process of finding the right people to be friends with unnecessarily difficult. Imagine you move to a new city after college - everyone already has established social groups, and you have no idea how to go about finding people that could be in your newest group of friends.  SixDegrees solves this problem by connecting you with the people that you should know, but don't. From your college roommate's childhood friend to someone who shares your love of knitting, SixDegrees unlocks the power of your existing social network. The SixDegrees interactive map shows you people near your location that you share mutual friends and mutual likes with. SixDegrees smoothes the transition from being acquaintances to being friends by offering intelligent location and time based suggestions for places to meet these new friends.
